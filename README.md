# Transcriptome Surfer
This a package developed to combine calcium imaging data with single cell transcriptome data. 
## 1. To get started on using this software navigate to the directory and simply double click `clickMe.Rdata`. This will open an R console, and load in all software and data.

## 2. The first question that will be asked is what profile you would like to use. If you want to make a new profile simply click **New profile** or click **Cancel**.

## 3. Answering `New profile` will next ask you the name of the new profile.

## 4. Starting from line three we are now working from scratch. The important thing to realize here is that we need to select search terms to find genes. 

  * First navigate into the folder named profiles
  * Find the profile you just created
  * Open the searches to find the first search terms we will use. Notice each search term is separated by new line. 
  * Spend some time exploring the folder [Lee Leavitt](./profiles/Lee_Leavitt/Searches) for a few examples of different types of searches you can do.

## 5. Now we will use the keyboard to guide us during the rest of the data analysis.
