# Saving

## Profiles
Working with different profiles allows you to pick up where you left off. It also saves your progress. From where you were working. For example to tell multiple data analysis stories, you can simply pick up from where you left off. Additionally at the end of the analysis the program will ask you two questions.

1. Would you like to rename the profile? If yes then rename it!
2. Would you like to continue? Yes will take you back through the whole operation again.
